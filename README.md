# Collection Management System

## Project Overview

The Small Collection Management System is a simplified application designed to manage customer payments and notifications. This system demonstrates the ability to work with full-stack technologies, real-time updates, and basic AI integration.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Authentication System

- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- JWT-based authentication.

### 2. Customer Management

- CRUD operations for customer details:
  - Name
  - Contact information
  - Outstanding payment amount
  - Payment due date
  - Payment status
- Bulk customer upload via Excel:
  - Provide a template for upload.
  - Validate data before import.
  - Show import success/error summary.
- List view with filtering and sorting options.

### 3. Payment Management

- Create a mock payment API endpoint.
- Mark payments as completed/pending.
- Real-time payment status updates using WebSocket.

### 4. Notification System

- Real-time notifications using WebSocket.
- Notification types:
  - Payment received.
  - Payment overdue.
  - New customer added.
- Notification center to view all notifications.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (Next.js)

- Clean and responsive UI.
- State management (Redux/Context API).
- Form validation.
- Loading states.
- Real-time updates.
- File upload handling.

### Backend (Node.js)

- RESTful API architecture.
- WebSocket implementation.
- File handling for Excel uploads.
- JWT authentication.
- Input validation.
- Error handling middleware.
- Logging system.

### Database

- MySQL.

### Documentation

- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

- API structure and documentation.
- Security implementation.

### 4. UI/UX Design

- Intuitive interface.
- Responsive design.
- Loading states.
- Error feedback.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Small-collection-management-system.git](https://github.com/pintu544/realtime-payment-collection-with-elasticdsearch)
   cd realtime-payment-collection-with-elasticdsearch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install for backend and frontend 
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** based on the `.env.example` file and configure your environment variables.

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technical Decisions Explanation

- **React.js/Next.js**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of integration with other libraries.
- **Context API**: Used for state management to keep the project simple and avoid the overhead of Redux.
- **Socket.io**: Used for real-time updates and notifications.
- **Node.js**: Chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture which is suitable for real-time applications.
- **MySQL**: Chosen for its structured query language and relational database management capabilities.
- **Elasticsearch**: Preferred for its powerful search and real-time data analysis capabilities.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit and integration tests.
- Improve error handling and user feedback.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
- Implement more advanced AI features for predictive analytics.
- Enhance security measures.

```plaintext
# MySQL configuration
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_DATABASE=your-db-name

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Elasticsearch configuration
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://your-elasticsearch-server:9200
ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=your-username
ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=your-password

# Socket.io configuration
SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Docker Configuration

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14

   # Create app directory
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   # Install app dependencies
   COPY package*.json ./

   RUN npm install

   # Bundle app source
   COPY . .

   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev" ]
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`**:

   ```yaml
   version: "3"
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       environment:
         - MYSQL_HOST=mysql
         - MYSQL_PORT=3306
         - MYSQL_USER=root
         - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=your-db-name
         - JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
         - ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200
         - ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=your-username
         - ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=your-password
         - SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
       depends_on:
         - mysql
         - elasticsearch

     mysql:
       image: mysql:5.7
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
         MYSQL_DATABASE: your-db-name
       ports:
         - "3306:3306"

     elasticsearch:
       image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.1
       environment:
         - discovery.type=single-node
       ports:
         - "9200:9200"
   ```

3. **Build and run the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
